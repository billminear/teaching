# Educational Resources

Here you'll find an ever-growing collection of resources that I utilize when teaching or learning a new topic. 

# automation

This directory contains automation showcases. Typically a mix of Python, Ansible, YAML, and Jinja2. Nothing too complex here - just simple examples of automating computer network tasks.

# management

This directory contains scripts I use when managing a class. The primary resource is a configuration grader (that's continually under development). Eventually, I'd like to include a lab builder using YAML and either Ansible or Python.

# labs

Personal and class-based lab resources.
