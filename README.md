# Educational Resources

Here you'll find an ever-growing collection of resources  
that I utilize when teaching.

# management

This directory contains scripts I use when managing a class. The primary resource is a configuration grader (that's continually under development). Eventually, I'd like to include a lab builder using YAML and either Ansible or Python.
