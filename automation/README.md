### Configuration Generation Example

The files in this repository are an example of using
Python, Jinja2, and YAML to create Cisco configurations.

I've intended for this to be a simple example where the
goal is to introduce these three technologies and how
they can be applied to improve configuration
generation. 

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3
- Jinja2 library

#### Environment Setup

- Clone repository.
- Install required libraries using requirements.txt.
- Modify .yaml and .j2 files as needed.
- Run create_configs.py.
- Output files are stored in a "configs" directory
  in the directory where create_configs.py was ran.
